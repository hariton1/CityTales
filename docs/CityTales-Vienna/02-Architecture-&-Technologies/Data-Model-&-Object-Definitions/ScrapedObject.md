- themeTags (List<String>): Tags used to classify the object (e.g., 'diplomacy', 'war') 

- source (String): Name of the source, e.g., 'Wikidata' 

- information accuracy index (float): index of how accurate the information is 

- interest (List<WeightedTopic>): List of topics associated with this object that a user could be interested in where each topic is weighted 

- relatedObjects (List<ScrapedObject>): List of Locations/Events/People related to this 

2.2 GeoPoint 

Represents the geographical location of an object. 

Fields: 

- lat (Float): Latitude
