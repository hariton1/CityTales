This folder contains all Files related to the 'old' data scraper which relied too much on the wikidata-api. 

# The reason the scraper was changed is that:
- manual scraping is not affected by rate limiting
- offers a more complete picture of the data at hand because everything that was previously in wikidata is in geschichte-wiki and more

# The reason that the scraper was not deleted:
- mainly for documentation purposes
- I imagine it would make sense to keep it for now so that code-parts can be easily extruded for other usages
